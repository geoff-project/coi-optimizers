Optimizer Wrappers for the Common Optimization Interfaces
=========================================================

CernML is the project of bringing numerical optimization, machine learning and
reinforcement learning to the operation of the CERN accelerator complex.

[CernML-COI][] defines common interfaces that facilitate using numerical
optimization and reinforcement learning (RL) on the same optimization problems.
This makes it possible to unify both approaches into a generic optimization
application in the CERN Control Center.

CernML-COI-Optimizers defines an abstract optimizer interface for all numerical
optimization algorithms. It also a registration mechanism to find all
available algorithms. Finally, it comes with wrappers for the following
third-party packages:

- [Scipy][],
- [Py-BOBYQA][],
- [CernML-Extremum-Seeking][],
- Bayesian optimization with [Scikit-Optimize][].

The optimizers are suitable to be hooked into the pre-implemented optimization
loop defined in [CernML-COI-Loops][].

This repository can be found online on CERN's [Gitlab][].

Motivation
----------

The [generic optimization framework & front-end][GeOFF] needs a way to start
optimization algorithms that is independent of the specific algorithm's API. It
also needs to configure them in a dynamic manner that cannot necessarily
anticipate the exact parameters supported by each algorithm.

This package helps solve this problem by providing a single interface that can
wrap around almost any single-objective minimization algorithm. The registry
system allows loading algorithms without hard-coding their location. The
[CernML-COI][] provide an API to configure these algorithms dynamically at
runtime.

Quickstart: Using an Optimizer
------------------------------

If you have a package created with [`acc-py init`][], add this package to your
dependencies and use the extra `all` to include all third-party wrappers:

```python
REQUIREMENTS: dict = {
    'core': [
        'cernml-coi-optimizers[all] ~= 1.0',
        ...
    ],
    ...
}
```

Use the registry APIs of the [COI][CernML-COI] and of this package to create
optimizer and optimization problem:

```python
# Run `pip install cern_awake_env` for this particular example.
import cern_awake_env
from cernml import coi, optimizers

env = coi.make("AwakeSimEnvH-v1")
opt = optimizers.make("BOBYQA")

result = optimizers.solve(opt, env)
```

Quickstart: Providing an Optimizer
----------------------------------

To write an optimizer, create a new package using [`acc-py init`][] and add
this package to the dependencies:

```python
REQUIREMENTS: dict = {
    'core': [
        'cernml-coi-optimizers ~= 1.0',
        ...
    ],
    ...
}
```

[`acc-py init`]: https://wikis.cern.ch/display/ACCPY/Getting+started+with+Acc-Py#GettingstartedwithAccPy-StartinganewPythonproject

Then write a subclass of `Optimizer` and register it:

```python
import typing as t

import numpy as np
from cernml.optimizers import Bounds, Objective, Optimizer, OptimizeResult, Solve
from cernml.coi import Constraint

class MyOptimizer(Optimizer):
    def make_solve_func(
        self, bounds: Bounds, constraints: t.Sequence[Constraint]
    ) -> Solve:
        def solve(obj: Objective, x0: np.ndarray) -> OptimizeResult:
            ...

        return solve

register("MyOptimizer-v1", MyOptimizer)
```

Any [*host application*][GeOFF] may then import your package and instantiate
your optimizer to solve its optimization problem:

```python
import numpy as np
import my_project
from cernml.optimizers import make

def objective(x: np.ndarray) -> float:
    return np.sum(x**4 - x**2)

x0 = np.array([0.0, 0.0])

opt = make("MyOptimizer-v1")
solve = opt.make_solve_func(bounds=(x0 - 2.0, x0 + 2.0), constraints=[])
results = solve(objective, x0)
```

Documentation
-------------

Inside the CERN network, you can read the package documentation on the [Acc-Py
documentation server][acc-py-docs]. The API is also documented via extensive
Python docstrings.

Changelog
---------

[See here](https://acc-py.web.cern.ch/gitlab/geoff/cernml-coi-optimizers/docs/stable/changelog.html).

Stability
---------

This package uses a variant of [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) that
makes additional promises during the initial development (major version 0):
whenever breaking changes to the public API are published, the first non-zero
version number will increase. This means that code that uses COI version 0.6.0
will continue to work with version 0.6.1, but may break with version 0.7.0.

The exception to this are the contents of `cernml.coi.unstable`, which may
change in any given release.
